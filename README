struct dNode
	holds discriminating information and either:
		1) pointers to left and right children or
		2) a two dimensional vector of values
	if (isLeaf == false) 1
	if (isLeaf == true) 2

func partition
	standard partitioning method for Lomuto's
	modifies the order of given two dimensional vector

func quickSelect
	finds the sorted position of given index;
	recursive

func median
	wrapper func of quickSelect to always find the lower median

func findRange
	calls quickSelect for the last and first indexes and returns the difference

func largestRangeDim
	returns the dimesion with the largest range in a two dimensional vector

func subVector
	returns a subVector with given bounds

func buildTree
	recursive
	builds kd tree with dNode
	end condition of given arr <= constant bucket size b

func printLeaf
	prints the given dNode* if it is a leaf

func probeTree
	recursively scale tree to find the probe's appropriate leaf and prints that leaf

func main 
	makes kd tree with k dimesions, n points, and p probes(./kd k n p)
	prints out the ouput of probes;
